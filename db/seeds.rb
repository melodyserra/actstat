The Homeless Children’s Network (HCN) provides comprehensive mental health services, case management, and family support services for homeless children, youth, and their families throughout San Francisco. HCN also provides a forum for networking, education, support and shared resources for the city-wide community of homeless family and children’s service providers. HCN’s Therapists serve over 2,000 unduplicated children ages 0-17 and their families per year. The families we serve represent a rich array of ethnicities and cultural backgrounds.", :website => "http://www.hcnkids.org/", :image => "http://i.imgur.com/WtHW3JW.png")
n2 = Nonprofit.create(:name => "Project Night Night", :mission => "Project Night Night provides individual tote bags containing a security blanket, age-appropriate books, and stuffed animals to homeless children in an effort to help homeless children have sweeter dreams. Homelessness affects every facet of a child's development, increasing the risk for developmental delays, learning disabilities, emotional and behavioral disorders, heath concerns, and deficient social skills. Project Night Night believes that these devastating effects can be mitigated by receiving a good night's sleep. Inadequate sleep can cause decreases in performance, concentration, learning, and health. Sleep deprivation can also increase behavior and mood problems as well as memory lapses. Children in homeless shelters do not have the luxury of falling asleep in the pristine conditions we, as parents, try to create for our children. Instead, children in shelters often endure an overcrowded, noisy, and unfamiliar environment in their quest for sleep. At Project Night Night, we hope that by receiving a package of familiar objects such as a security blanket, books, and a stuffed animal, homeless children will be able to have sweeter dreams.", :website => "http://www.projectnightnight.org/", :image => "http://i.imgur.com/0eccsi5.png")

Our innovative model focuses on young people who do not access traditional services and are disconnected from any type of consistent support. We remove common barriers to service by bringing our counselors onto the streets, and shaping our support services around the needs of each individual client.", :website => "http://atthecrossroads.org/", :image => "http://i.imgur.com/5GhdqdI.gif")
